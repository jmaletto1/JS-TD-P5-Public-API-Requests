# JS-TD-P5-Public-API-Requests
 
The Public API Request Project, by Johnny Austen

Overview

This project pulls data from the random user API and displays the results to the page. Once 12 results have been pulled,
they are copied into an array, before being displayed in rows on-page. Visitors are able to click on the full card item of each
user, which in turn launches a modal window that displays more information on the relevant user. The modal window displays a 
'close' button, as well as toggle buttons at the bottom, which let the visitor switch to the previous or next user. Additionally,
clients are able to perform a search on the 12 users displayed on the page. I chose to have this update in real time, using the
'keyup' method, as opposed to relying on the submit button being activated.

Notes

CSS Changes

1) Added a background image to the main body in the styles.css file. This was re-sized and compressed using Preview.
2) Changed the colour properties of the 'name' value for both the Card and Modal displays in styles.css.
3) Changed the colour property of the H1 in styles.css
